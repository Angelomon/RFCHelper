# RFCHelper
 A set of tools that improve the usability of librw's conversion tools

 RFC Helper is basically an interface that helps you convert files between renderware versions in a few seconds, and automates a series of processes that would take a few minutes to complete. I initially designed to support automatic vehicle collision embed, and texture conversion. But they are not fully implemented.
